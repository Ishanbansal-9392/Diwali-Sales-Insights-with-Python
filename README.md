Conducted a detailed analysis of Diwali season sales data using Python to uncover customer behavior patterns, optimize marketing strategies, and support data-driven retail decision-making. The project involved end-to-end data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of sales and demographic trends.
**Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Key Responsibilities & Tasks:**

**Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
Loaded and inspected the dataset using pandas.
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.
Standardized column names and formatted categorical fields for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
**Used groupby() and aggregations to analyze:**
Sales by gender, age group, marital status, occupation, and product categories.
Spending behavior based on city tiers and customer demographics.
Identified high-revenue customer segments and product categories.

**Data Visualization:**
Created insightful charts using matplotlib and seaborn, including:
Bar charts, histograms, box plots, and count plots to show distribution patterns.
Heatmaps and pair plots to visualize correlations and trends.
Highlighted top-performing product categories and target demographics.

**Customer Insights:**
Identified customer groups contributing most to Diwali sales (e.g., married women from Tier 1 cities).
Recommended focus areas for marketing and inventory based on purchase patterns.

**Outcome & Impact:**
Delivered clear and actionable insights to optimize product offerings and promotional strategies during the Diwali season.
Helped improve understanding of customer behavior across different segments and cities.
Demonstrated practical application of Python in solving real-world business problems through data analysis and visualization.
